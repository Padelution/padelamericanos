# The Ultimate Guide to Team Americano

## Introduction
Team Americano has the same basic idea as Padel Americano, but instead of switching partners after every round, you stick with the same player until the end. This is a great way to get more familiar with your partner during the event and actually learn about their way of playing. This will also improve your playing! Another benefit of Team Americano is that during the match, you are able to become a better team and improve your odds of winning.

## What do you need for Team Americano??
The setup is very similar to regular Padel Americano. For optimal fun, it's recommended that you have at least 4 teams, which means 8 players. Then, depending on how many players you have, you need a padel court (see table below for optimal amount of courts vs. amount of players).  Similarly to regular Americano, it's a good idea to have some kind of system or app to keep score. Also, for this, [Padelution](https://www.padelution.com/americano) makes it very easy.

| Number of teams | Minimum number of courts |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
|      4 to 7     |             2            |
|     8 to 11     |             3            |
|     12 to 15    |             4            |
|     16 to 19    |             5            |
|     20 to 23    |             6            |

## The rules of team Americano
The basic idea is that every team plays against all other teams during the event, so compared to regular Americano, there is no rotation inside the teams. 

For example, you are playing on two courts and you are now team A. You start playing against team B. After the first round is finished, you will either stay on the same court or switch courts, but the main thing is that you will next play against team C. After the second round is finished, you all rotate again, and next you play against team D. 

Basic rules of padel apply, so if you don’t agree on whether a ball was in or out, it's good to repeat the point and move on fairly quickly. Picking the first server can also be done the way the players are used to, like playing a “server’s ball” or tossing a coin.

## Example of rounds(from team A perspective):
- Round 1 - Team A vs. Team B
- Round 2  - Team A vs. Team C
- Round 3 - Team A vs. Team D

### Scoring and how to win
Each round is typically played to a total of 32 points. Every player serves 4 times before rotating to the next server. A key point to remember is that, for example, if your team earns 15 points and the opposing team earns 17 points, you will assign 15 points to your team and 17 points to the opposing team. Total points played is now 32, and your round is finished.

After each round, it's essential to record the scores on a scoreboard or in some organized system, i.e. Padelution. The team with the most points accumulated by the end of the event is declared the winner. It's a good idea to designate someone to track the scores, ensuring that all points are properly recorded throughout the event.

### After the time is up
After the time is up or all teams have played against each other at least two times, it's time to see which team collected the most points. Remember that, unlike in regular Americano, you win and lose together as a team, so the final scoreboard should show the teams organised in descending order starting with the team which has the most points collected.

Once the official matches are over, why not relax with some drinks at the lounge and mingle with other players? After all, socializing is one of the best parts of playing padel!

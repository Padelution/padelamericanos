If you enjoy the dynamic and adaptive nature of Padel Mexicano but want to emphasize teamwork and long-term strategy, **Team Mexicano** is the perfect choice.

In this guide, we’ll dive into what makes Team Mexicano unique, how it works, and why it’s a fantastic option for both casual and competitive play.

## **What Is Team Mexicano?**

Team Mexicano is a variation of the traditional Mexicano format where two players always compete as a fixed team. Unlike regular Mexicano, where partners rotate between matches, Team Mexicano keeps partnerships intact, allowing players to develop and refine their strategies as a pair.

### **Key Features of Team Mexicano**
- **Fixed Teams**: Two players form a team and compete together throughout the tournament.
- **Dynamic Pairings**: Teams are paired against others based on leaderboard standings, just like in regular Mexicano.
- **Focus on Strategy**: Players can build stronger teamwork and tactics as they face a variety of opponents.

## **How Does Team Mexicano Work?**

The format follows the same adaptive principles as Mexicano but with fixed partnerships.

### **Match Pairing**
- The first match pairing is determined randomly, with teams assigned opponents through a lottery.
- From the second match onward, pairings are based on leaderboard rankings:
  - The top two teams play against each other.
  - The third and fourth-ranked teams play against each other.
  - Lower-ranked teams are paired similarly to ensure balanced matches.

### **Match Format**
- Matches are played to a set number of points, usually 16, 24, or 32. Alternatively, a set time limit of 10–20 minutes can be used.
- Serving rules remain the same as Mexicano:
  - Each team serves 4 or 6 times before the serve rotates.
  - Every point scored adds to the team’s overall score.

## **Scoring in Team Mexicano**

The scoring system for Team Mexicano is straightforward and mirrors that of Mexicano:

1. **Points Per Match**: Each team’s score from a match is added to their cumulative total.
   - For example, if a match ends 20–12, the winning team adds 20 points, and the losing team adds 12 points to their scores.
2. **Leaderboard Rankings**: Teams are ranked on the leaderboard based on their total points across all matches.
3. **Winner**: The team with the highest score at the end of the tournament wins.

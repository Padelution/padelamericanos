# Mixicano: A Unique Padel Format for Mixed Teams

Mixicano is an exciting twist on the traditional Americano format, designed to bring balance, inclusivity, and variety to padel. The key feature of Mixicano is that it ensures every team is a mixed pairing, with one man and one woman playing together. This format emphasizes teamwork, communication, and camaraderie across genders.

Alternatively, Mixicano can also be played by pairing players based on their preferred court sides, where a "left-side" player teams up with a "right-side" player, allowing both to perform at their best on their preferred sides. 

In this guide, we’ll explore the rules, organization, and unique aspects of Mixicano.

## **What Is Mixicano?**

Mixicano combines the dynamic, adaptive nature of Americano with a fixed rule that all teams must be mixed:
- **Mixed Teams**: Every team consists of one man and one woman. No teams can have two men or two women.
- **Preferred Side Teams** (Optional): Instead of gender-based pairings, players can be matched as "left-side" and "right-side" players to maximize their strengths.

This format adds a layer of strategy and balance to the traditional Americano setup, making it both fun and competitive.

## **How Does Mixicano Work?**

### **Initial Pairings**
- In the first match, teams are randomly drawn, ensuring that each team consists of one man and one woman (or one left-side and one right-side player, depending on the format).
  
### **Dynamic Pairing System**
- In Mixicano, each player teams up with every other player of the opposite gender (or from the opposite side, if using the "left-side/right-side" format) exactly once.
- Pairings are pre-determined to ensure that everyone gets an equal chance to play with and against all participants.
- For example:
  - **Round 1**: Player 1 (man) and Player 2 (woman) vs. Player 3 (man) and Player 4 (woman)
  - **Round 2**: Player 1 (man) and Player 4 (woman) vs. Player 2 (woman) and Player 3 (man)
  - **Round 3**: Player 1 (man) and Player 3 (woman) vs. Player 2 (man) and Player 4 (woman)

This ensures variety in partnerships while maintaining the core rule that each team is always a mix of genders (or left/right side preferences). By the end of the tournament, every participant will have played alongside every eligible partner and competed against every opponent.

### **Match Format**
- Matches are played to a set number of points, typically 16, 24, or 32, or within a fixed time limit (e.g., 10–20 minutes).
- Teams accumulate points during each match, and the scores contribute to individual standings.

## **Scoring in Mixicano**

The scoring system in Mixicano mirrors that of Americano, with a focus on individual point accumulation:

1. **Points Per Match**: Each team's score is split equally among its members.
   - For example, if a match ends 20–12, the winning team’s players each earn 20 points, while the losing team’s players each earn 12 points.
2. **Leaderboard Rankings**: Players are ranked based on their cumulative points.
3. **Winner**: The player with the most points at the end of the tournament is crowned the winner.

## **Organizing a Mixicano Tournament**

Mixicano tournaments require some additional planning to ensure balanced team pairings. Here’s how to organize one:

### **Participants and Courts**
- You’ll need an even number of men and women (or left-side and right-side players).
- The number of courts required depends on the total participants:
  - 8 players (4 men, 4 women) = 2 courts
  - 12 players (6 men, 6 women) = 3 courts
  - 16 players (8 men, 8 women) = 4 courts

### **Match Scheduling**
- Pairings are determined randomly for the first match, and dynamically based on standings thereafter.
- Ensure no man-and-man or woman-and-woman teams (or no left-side/left-side or right-side/right-side pairings) during any match.

### **Match Duration**
- Plan for 10–15 minutes per match or set a specific number of points, like 16, 24, or 32.
- A full tournament with 8 players typically lasts 2–3 hours.

### **Scorekeeping**
- Use a scorecard or app to record match results and update individual standings dynamically.

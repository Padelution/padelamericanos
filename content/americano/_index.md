# Padel Americano - All you need to know

Padel americano is a great alternative to the original way of playing padel. The basic idea of padel americano is that during the event, after every round, you rotate teams so every player plays with each other. This exactly makes Americano so popular and fun! Playing with the same partner for a long time starts to lose the excitement, and that's why everyone should try Padel Americano. It's also a very good way to meet new people and play with them. For players who also like to get better, it helps to play with different levels of players.

## What is needed to play Americano

To play Americano, you don’t need a lot of extra things compared to the original way of playing. Of course, you need to have players, and usually, to have fun, it's good to have a minimum of 8 players and, if possible, 2 courts booked (See more examples from the table below). If you have 8 players, a good duration for court booking is 2h.

| Number of players                                         | Minimum number of courts |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|                           4 to 7                          |             1            |
|                          8 to 11                          |             2            |
|                          12 to 15                         |             3            |
|                          16 to 19                         |             4            |
|                          20 to 23                         |             5            |



Extra players can rest and cheer while others are playing

Then of course you will need balls for all courts and other basic equipment for all players, like rackets. Before starting, it's good to divide all players into the courts and to make sure that every player knows how to play padel and then explain how Padel Americano works. One important thing is to have a good, easy-to-use tool to keep score after every round. One great example is Padelution.com.

## You will need:

- Players with basic equipment to play padel, i.e. sporting clothes, padel racket, and shoes.
- Booked courts depending on the number of players joining.
- Balls for each court, with three balls per court being optimal.
- System to keep scores, i.e. [Padelution](https://padelution.com/americano)
- At least one person to explain the rules and to make sure all scores are collected after each round.

## The rules of Padel Americano

The rules are simple and easy to learn. The basic idea is that every player plays with each other during the event. Also, everyone should face each other twice, but this depends also on the time that is reserved for playing. 

To win, you need to collect the biggest amount of points, so in this format, you are collecting points for yourself. For example, you are playing on two courts and you are now player A. You start with player B and play against players C & D. After your round is finished, you will either stay on the same court or switch courts, but the main thing is that you will next play with player C against players B and D. After the second round is finished, you all rotate again, and next, you play with player F against G & H. 

Basic rules of padel apply, so if there are different views on if the ball was out, it's good to repeat the point and move on fairly quickly. Picking the first server can also be done the way the players are used to, so playing a “server’s ball” or tossing a coin. Every player serves four points, and then you rotate the server with the opposing team.

### Example of rounds (from Player A perspective):
- Round 1 - Player A&B vs. player C&D
- Round 2  - Player A&C vs. player B&D
- Round 3 - Player A&F vs. player G&H

### Scoring and how to win
Every round is usually played until a total of 32 points, and every player serves 4 times, and then you rotate the server. For example, let's say that your team collects 15 points, and the other team collects 17 points. This means that the total points played now is 32, so it's time to rotate. 

To the scoring system, you then add 15 points to your team / both of you, and the opponent gets 17 points each. Then let's say that you and your partner score 20 points during the second match, which means that the opponent’s score is 12 points. 

Alternatively, you can also have a fixed time and play until the time is up and collect points until that. After every round is played, it's important to add scores in some system or scoreboard. 

The player who has collected the most points after the event is done is the winner. It's usually a good idea to have someone responsible for collecting scores so that all points are registered after the event.

### When it’s time to stop playing
After the time is up, it’s time to see who collected the most points. Of course, if there is still time after everyone has played with each other, you can play extra rounds. If time is up before everyone has played against each other, it's usually a good idea to just equalise the points with everyone.

After the official part of playing is done, why not enjoy some drinks at the lounge if possible and socialise with other players? That's one of the best aspects of Padel anyway!

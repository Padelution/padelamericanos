# Team Mexicano: A Guide to This Exciting Team-Based Padel Format

Team Mexicano offers another dynamic method for choosing opponents. The key factor is your team’s ranking, and after each round, you check where you stand in the ranking to find out who you’ll be playing against in the next round. 

What makes it enjoyable is the way that teams rotate after every round which means that the skill level gaps are balanced out. This ensures that every team can expect  close and exciting matches.

## What Do You Need for Team Mexicano?

For Team Mexicano, you don’t need anything extra compared to a regular Mexicano, except for a system or app to keep score. Services like [Padelution](https://www.padelution.com/americano) can be used to track the scores. 

It’s important to have a clear method for recording scores, as each team’s ranking after every round determines who they’ll go against next. A minimum of 4 teams/8 players is recommended, and the optimal amount of courts is 2. You can increase the number of teams, but it’s best to have a number of courts that’s divisible by 4 to ensure smooth rotation and
that all teams are playing at the same time.


## Rules of Team Mexicano

All the basic rules of padel apply when playing Team Mexicano. To start, you can randomly select the first pairs. From the second round onward, however, you need to track the scores and let the system handle the rotation. Teams ranked 1 and 3 will, in the second round, play against each other and teams ranked 2 and 4 will go against each other on the other court.

- **Fixed Teams**: Two players form a team and compete together throughout the tournament.
- **Dynamic Pairings**: Teams are paired against others based on leaderboard standings, just like in regular Mexicano.

| Standings after first round | Matches for 2nd round |
|:---------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|            Team 1           |   Team 1 vs. Team 2   |
|            Team 2           |                       |
|            Team 3           |   Team 3 vs. Team 4   |
|            Team 4           |                       |

## How does the scoring work?

The scoring works the same way as in Americano and regular Mexicano. Each match is played until a total of 32 points have been scored. For example, if your team (Team 1) plays against Team 4 and your team scores 20 points, then Team 4 will get 12 points. This means that a total of 32 points have now been played and it's time to move on to the next round.

### Example of scoring from team 1 perspective
- Round 1: Team 1 20 points and team 4 12 points
- Round 2: Team 1 19 points and team 2 13 points

Total points accumulated after two rounds is 39 for team 1


### Then, who is the Winner?
At the end of the event, the team in first place in the rankings is the winner, followed by the teams in second, third, and so on. The biggest upside of Team Mexicano  is that, because of how teams are rotated after every round based on rankings, all the matches remain close and competitive, ensuring a fun experience for everyone involved.

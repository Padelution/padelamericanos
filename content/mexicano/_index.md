# Padel Mexicano: A Complete Guide to This Dynamic Format

Mexicano has a fun and dynamic way of rotating partners and opponents. The deciding factor is where you are in the ranking, and after each round, you go back, see where you land in the ranking, and then you see who you are playing with next. 

The fun factor is that the way that players are rotated keeps the matches close since the standings determine how the teams are put together for every round. This way, the skill level gaps even out, and everyone can enjoy close and tight matches.

## What do you need for Mexicano?

For Mexicano, you don’t need anything extra when comparing to regular Padel matches except some system or app to keep score. You can use, for example, services like Padelution to keep score. It is important to have some clear way for the scoring since after every round, the teams of the next round are determined by each player's ranking. 

It's good to have at least 8 players, and the optimal court amount is 2. You can grow the number of players to as many as you want, but keep in mind that it's good to have a number of courts divisible by 4 so rotation goes smoothly, and everyone will be playing at the same time.

## Rules of Mexicano
All the basic rules of padel apply when playing Mexicano. To start, you can randomly pick the first pairs to start with. Starting from the second round, though, you will let the system do its thing to show you how the rotation of players will be done. Players ranked 1 and 3 will, in the next round, play against players ranked 2 and 4. On the other court, players ranked 5 and 7 will play against players ranked 6 and 8, and so on.

| Standings after first round | Teams for 2nd round |
|:---------------------------:|:-------------------:|
|              1              |     1/3 vs. 2/4     |
|              2              |                     |
|              3              |                     |
|              4              |                     |
|              5              |     5/7 vs. 6/8     |
|              6              |                     |
|              7              |                     |
|              8              |                     |


### Example of scoring from team A perspective
- Round 1: Players A&D 20 points and players B&C 12 points
- Round 2: Players A&C 19 points and players B&D 13 points

Total points player A has accumulated after two rounds is 39


### Then who is the winner?
After the time is up, the winner is the player who is in first place in the rankings. The most important factor should still be the fact that all matches were tight because of the way teams are picked after every round based on players' standings.

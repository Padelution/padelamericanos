## What Is Team Americano?
Team Americano is played with fixed pairs, where two players form a team and compete against other teams in short, high-energy matches. Unlike traditional Americano, partners do not rotate, allowing teams to build and execute long-term strategies.

- **Players**: 8, 12, 16, or more players divided into teams of two.
- **Teams**: Typically 4 or more teams.
- **Match Duration**: Each match is played to a set number of points (usually 32).
- **Scoring**: Cumulative points across all matches determine the winning team.

## How to Organize a Team Americano Tournament
Organizing a Team Americano tournament is straightforward with proper planning. Follow these steps:

### 1. Determine the Number of Teams
Team Americano works best with 4 or more teams:
- 8 players = 4 teams
- 12 players = 6 teams
- 16 players = 8 teams

### 2. Create a Match Schedule
Plan a rotation so that all teams face each other. For 4 teams (Team A, B, C, D):
- Match 1: Team A vs. Team B
- Match 2: Team C vs. Team D
- Match 3: Team A vs. Team C
- Match 4: Team B vs. Team D
- Continue until all teams have played.

For more teams, adjust the rotation accordingly to ensure fairness.

### 3. Set the Match Rules
- **Points**: Each match is played to a fixed number of points (e.g., 32).
- **Switch Sides**: Switch sides every 16 points to balance environmental factors.
- **Cumulative Scoring**: Teams earn points in each match, which are added to their total score.

### 4. Record Scores
Use a scoreboard or americano app to track the points each team earns across matches.

### 5. Determine Winners
At the end of the tournament, the team with the highest cumulative score is declared the winner. In case of a tie, consider a playoff match.
